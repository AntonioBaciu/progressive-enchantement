          Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
          evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br />
          They said,
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- ==============QUOTE================ -->
        <q class="villagers"
          >We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
          unfortunate.</q
        ><br />

        <p>The farmer said,</p>
        <br />

        <!-- ==============QUOTE================ -->
        <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q><br />

        <p>
          The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
          and in the evening everybody came back and said,
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- ==============QUOTE================ -->
        <q class="villagers"
          >Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
          horses!</q
        ><br />

        <p>The farmer again said,</p>

        <!-- ==============QUOTE================ -->
        <br /><q><em>Maybe</em>.</q><br />

        <p>
          The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
          riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.<br />
          The neighbors then said,
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- ==============QUOTE================ -->
        <q class="villagers"
          >Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q
        ><br />

        <p>and the farmer responded,</p>
        <br />

        <!-- ==============QUOTE================ -->
        <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q><br />

        <p>
          The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
          into the army,<br />
          and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.<br />
          Again all the neighbors came around and said,
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- ==============QUOTE================ -->
        <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q><br />

        <p>Again, he said,</p>
        <br />

        <!-- ==============QUOTE================ -->
        <q><em>Maybe</em>.</q><br />

          <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are

          bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
